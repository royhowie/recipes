Ingredients:
    - 1 slice of bread
    - 1 ripe banana
    - peanut butter

Steps:
    1. Toast bread.
    2. Slather with peanut butter.
    3. Slice and lay pieces of banana onto toast.

Note:
    Of utmost importance is the choice of bread and the brand of peanut butter.
    While I prefer "Seeduction" from Whole Foods, I would not turn down a
    hearty rye (like pumpernickel) or well-rounded whole-wheat. On the other
    hand, every jar of peanut butter I have tried so far pales in comparison to
    Santa Cruz Dark Roasted. There is no substitute.

    Second, appropriate peanut butter thickness matters. Do not go overboard,
    but also do not skimp.

    Third, make sure to use a banana which has ripened long enough to embrace
    its inner leopard. Do not use green or unripe bananas, which are simply
    unpalatable.

    Last, take extra care to lay slices of banana in an artful pattern
    resembling bracts of an artichoke or scales on a fish. This will greatly
    improve the taste. Believe me.
